# My Webpage

Personal website written in SvelteKit. You can visit it live
[here!](https://noway.moe) It also contains a prettier rendition of my
[configs'](https://codeberg.org/akemi/dotfiles.git)
[notes](https://codeberg.org/akemi/dotfiles/src/branch/main/notes), which non-vim users will
appreciate

## Building

I was told to use `yarn`, so here are the steps for that

```bash
please pacman -S yarn
git clone 'https://codeberg.org/akemi/website' site
cd site
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Project layout is following SvelteKit conventions as closely as possible
